# Metal-Smart-Extractors-From-Dustbin
Final Year Project for solving current waste management.
Here We have made a Dustbin with some high levels sensors which can do the Seperation work as well as object detecion work. Also we have added a alert system which can give alert to users when dustbin gets full at certain level like in our case we keep 90% level to give alert to users with location as well as with the time & date.
